In this project we demonstrate how to write a Python script that efficiently parses and computes metrics from log data provided through stdin. By using the log parsing script, we analyze the log data and obtain valuable insights about the total file size and the distribution of HTTP status codes in the log. The script can be extended and modified to handle real log files from various applications and systems.
